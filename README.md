# Wacom Overlay

I'm a teacher. I don't like writing on the whiteboard, so I bought a Wacom tablet to write on instead. Then I realized I needed a way to quickly switch between drawing and clicking. I wanted to be able to draw with my Wacom tablet without loosing the ability to click on things with my normal mouse. I could not find an existing app which was able to do this very simple thing!

**This application was 98% written by Claude Code!** I have not even looked at most of the code myself. That said, I've spent quite a bit of time working on it (AI coding still takes time!), and I consider it relatively polished.

The app was tested on Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks with Wacom Drivers 6.3.18-4 and the following Wacom tablets:
- Wacom Intuos P S CTL-490
- Wacom Intuos PT M CTH-690
